1. Explain the overall design of your program and justify why you chose this particular class structure and set of user-defined methods.

I created a Student Grade Management System using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). 
I used a `Student` class to store the student’s name and grades, and I added methods to input grades, calculate the average, and display the result. 
I chose this design because it keeps the program organized and easy to understand.

2. Describe how user input is handled in your program and discuss the role of exception handling (try–except) in preventing incorrect or unexpected behavior.

I handled user input using the `input()` function and used `try–except` to catch errors. 
This allows the program to handle invalid inputs such as non-numeric grades or values outside the allowed range. 
Using exception handling prevents the program from crashing and makes it more user-friendly.

3. Identify one limitation of your current implementation and explain how it could be improved using additional OOP concepts or better error handling.

One limitation of my program is that it only works for one student and does not save data. 
I can improve this by adding support for multiple students, saving data to a file, or using more OOP concepts in the future.
